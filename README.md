## Dataset
1. **Ontario_Demand**: The amount of electrity needed for one day in Ontario
2. **Windchill_Index**: The cooling effect of wind blowing on a surface.
3. **Wind_Speed**: The rate at which air is moving in a particular area
4. **Humidex**: A value that is calculated rather than measured
5. **Relative_Humidity**: The amount of water vapour present in air expressed as a percentage of the amount needed for saturation at the same temperature
6. **Pressure_Station**: The pressure that is observed at a specific elevation and is the true barometric pressure of a location

This dataset is presented with **12** columns and **39408** rows
